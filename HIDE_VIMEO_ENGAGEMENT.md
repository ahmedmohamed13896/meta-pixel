# How to Hide Vimeo Engagement Buttons

## ✅ Code Updated

I've added URL parameters to hide engagement buttons:
- `share=0` - Hides share button
- `like=0` - Hides like button  
- `watch_later=0` - Hides watch later button

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Some engagement buttons may still appear** because Vimeo controls these settings in your Vimeo account, not just through URL parameters.

### To Completely Hide Engagement Buttons:

1. **Log in to Vimeo**
2. **Go to your video** (e.g., Zaabal video)
3. **Click "Settings"** or the gear icon
4. **Go to "Appearance"** → **"Embed"** tab
5. **Scroll to "Engagement" section**
6. **Turn OFF:**
   - ✅ Like button
   - ✅ Share button
   - ✅ Watch Later button
   - ✅ Embed button (if you want)
7. **Click "Save"**

**Note:** These settings require a **Vimeo paid plan** (Plus, Pro, Business, or Premium). Free accounts have limited customization options.

## 📝 Current Code Settings

The embed URL now includes:
```
share=0&like=0&watch_later=0
```

These parameters will hide the buttons **if your Vimeo account settings allow it**.

## 🎯 Alternative Solution

If you can't access Vimeo settings or have a free account:

1. **Upgrade to Vimeo Plus/Pro** (starts at $12/month)
2. **Or use CSS overlay** to hide buttons (less reliable)
3. **Or use a different video hosting** (YouTube unlisted, self-hosted)

## ✅ What's Working Now

- ✅ Code updated with hide parameters
- ✅ Share button should be hidden
- ✅ Like button should be hidden
- ✅ Watch later should be hidden

**If buttons still appear**, you need to update the settings in your Vimeo account.
